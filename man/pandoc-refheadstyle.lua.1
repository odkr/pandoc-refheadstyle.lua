.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
pandoc [...] \-\-lua\-filter pandoc\-refheadstyle.lua\-0.2.3/pandoc\-refheadstyle.lua [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBpandoc\-refheadstyle.lua\fP sets a custom style for the reference section
header, that is, if the metadata field \fBreference\-section\-title\fP has been
set to a non\-empty value.
.sp
By default, the reference section header will be assigned the custom style
\(aqBibliography Heading\(aq. But you can assign another style by setting the
metadata field \fBreference\-header\-style\fP to the name of a style of your
choice. If the style does not exist, it will be created.
.sp
By fiat, the reference section header is the first header, starting from the
end of the document and ignoring the reference section itself, that has the
ID \(aqbibliography\(aq and the header text set in \fBreference\-section\-title\fP\&.
(A header inserted by \fBpandoc\-citeproc\fP will meet these criteria.)
.SH CAVEATS
.sp
\fBpandoc\-refheadstyle.lua\fP starts looking for a reference header at the
end of document but changes direction whenever it descends the document\(aqs
abstract syntax tree. That is, it will prefer the first header within the
last top\-level block to the last header within the last top\-level block.
