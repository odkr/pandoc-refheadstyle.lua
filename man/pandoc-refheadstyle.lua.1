.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
pandoc [...] \-\-lua\-filter pandoc\-refheadstyle.lua [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBpandoc\-refheadstyle.lua\fP sets a custom style for the reference section
header, that is, if the metadata field \fBreference\-section\-title\fP has been
set to a non\-empty value.
.sp
By default, the reference section header will be assigned the custom style
\(aqBibliography Heading\(aq. But you can assign another style by setting the metadata
field \fBreference\-header\-style\fP to the name of a style of your choice.
If the style does not exist, it will be created.
.sp
\fBpandoc\-refheadstyle.lua\fP considers any header the first header that meets
\fIall\fP of the following four conditions the reference section header:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
It\(aqs one of the last five top\-level elements of the document.
.IP 2. 3
It\(aqs a level\-one header.
.IP 3. 3
It has the ID \(aqbibliography\(aq.
.IP 4. 3
It\(aqs header text is that set in \fBreference\-section\-title\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If your reference section header has been inserted by \fBpandoc\-citeproc\fP,
it will meet all of those criteria.
