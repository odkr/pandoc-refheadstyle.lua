pandoc-refheadstyle.lua - sets a custom style for the reference section
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]pandoc\f[R] \f[B]\[en]lua-filter\f[R] \f[I]pandoc-zotxt.lua\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-refheadstyle.lua\f[R] sets a custom style for the reference
section header, but only if the metadata field
\f[C]reference-section-title\f[R] has been set to a non-empty value.
.PP
By default, the reference section header will be assigned the custom
style \[lq]Bibliography Heading\[rq].
But you can assign another style by setting the metadata field
\f[C]reference-header-style\f[R] to the name of a style of your choice.
If the style does not exist, it will be created.
.PP
The reference section header is, by stipulation, the first header,
starting from the end of the document and ignoring the reference section
itself, that has the ID \[lq]bibliography\[rq] and the text of which is
the one set in \f[C]reference-section-title\f[R].
(Headers inserted by \f[B]pandoc-citeproc\f[R] meet these criteria.)
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-refheadstyle.lua\f[R] starts looking for a reference header
at the end of document but changes direction whenever it descends the
document\[cq]s abstract syntax tree.
That is, it will prefer the first header within the last top-level block
to the last header within the last top-level block.
