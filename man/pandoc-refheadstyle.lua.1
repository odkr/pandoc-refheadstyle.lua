.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
pandoc [...] \-\-lua\-filter pandoc\-refheadstyle.lua [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBpandoc\-refheadstyle.lua\fP sets a custom style for the reference section
header, but only if the metadata field \fBreference\-section\-title\fP has been
set to a non\-empty value.
.sp
By default, the reference section header will be assigned the custom style
\(aqBibliography Heading\(aq. But you can define which style should be assigned
by setting the metadata field \fBreference\-header\-style\fP to the name of
a style of your choice. If the style does not exist, it will be created.
.sp
\fBpandoc\-refheadstyle.lua\fP considers any header the reference section header
that (1) is one of the last five elements of the document, (2) is a top\-level
header, (3) has the ID \(aqbibliography\(aq, and (4) has a header text that is
equal to the value of the metadata field \fBreference\-section\-title\fP (\fIall\fP
criteria have to be met). If your reference section header was inserted by
\fBpandoc\-citeproc\fP, all of these criteria will be met.
